## Bear Walker Kit v3.0  
## for BG2: ToB / BGT / TuTu / BGEE / BG2EE / EET  
  
This is a small kit mod that offers the possibility to play as a ranger/werebear.
  
**Overview**  
Available languages: // English // German //  
The Bear Walker Kit will be available to every race with access to the ranger class.  
The character will be limited to studded leather armor and also be less proficient with melee
weapons. At level 1 he will gain the ability to shapeshift into werebear form, which will scale up as
the character's level advances.  

**You can choose between the Enhanced Edition version for EE games or, STANDARD and LIGHT
version for classic games.**

The **STANDARD** version requires the Infinity Animation core mod to be (or get) installed, but
offers a true werebear animation in return. (You should really really use this version if you can.)  

The **LIGHT** version is for people who cannot or do not wish to use Infinity Animation core mod.
Unfortunately this also means, that your werebear will have the in-game appearance of an ordinary
brown bear.

**Note:** As of v1.8 you can install the STANDARD version, even if the Infinity Animation core mod is
not installed. (You will still get a warning and be required to confirm that you really want to
proceed). This was done to enable you to install the Bear Walker kit in an early stage of a megainstallation
and thereby increase compatibility with mods, which are intended to affect all character
kits. You still need to install the I.A core mod later on, or the kit will be broken.
